3. **Greystar**
    Greystar is a significant player in the real estate sector, specializing in investment management, property management, and development. They are noted for their substantial footprint in the US rental market and beyond, with operations extending to 17 countries and 241 markets globally, covering regions across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. As of 2023, Greystar managed over 822,100 multifamily units and student beds globally, making them one of the largest apartment managers in the United States. 

    Here are some intriguing aspects of Greystar:
    1. Greystar has engaged in strategic acquisitions as part of its growth strategy. Notable acquisitions include the purchase of Alliance Residential's property management business and acquiring the remaining interest in Thackeray Partners, reflecting a robust strategy to expand and improve its services in the real estate sector
    2. Greystar operates with a unique business model that integrates owning, operating, and developing a variety of rental housing properties, including multifamily, student, and senior housing. This integrated approach allows Greystar to provide a comprehensive range of services in the real estate domain
    3. Similar to senior housing, Greystar’s involvement in student housing demonstrates their comprehensive approach to property management, addressing the unique needs of different resident demographics.
    
    Regarding the property management software they use, it seems Greystar employs a mix of external software and proprietary technology.

These software help in managing rental rates based on market data, among other functionalities. Additionally, Greystar has a platform named "Greystar Advantage Solutions," which supplements their core property management operations.
